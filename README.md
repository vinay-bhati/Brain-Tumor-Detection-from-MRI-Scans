# Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks 🧠💻

## Introduction
Brain tumor detection is a crucial task in medical imaging analysis, as it aids in the early diagnosis and treatment of brain-related medical conditions. In this project, we leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain tumor MRI images and assist medical professionals in accurate diagnosis.

## What is Brain Tumor Detection ❓
Brain tumor detection involves the analysis of medical imaging data, such as MRI scans, to identify the presence, location, and characteristics of tumors within the brain. It plays a vital role in facilitating timely medical interventions and improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project comprises MRI images from the Brain Tumor Classification MRI dataset available on Kaggle. It consists of four classes: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. The dataset is organized into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
